# Ninja Jobs

Rails CRUD app for Ninjas looking for jobs. 🙄 yeah I know

## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```bash
$ cd /path/to/repos
$ git clone https://github.com/tomhockett/ninja-jobs.git
$ cd ninja-jobs
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```bash
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```bash
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```bash
$ rails server
```
